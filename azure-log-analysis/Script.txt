Explanation of the Script
This script automates the process of querying Azure Monitor Logs to identify failed HTTP requests in a web application. 
Here's a breakdown of what it does:

Functionality:
Authenticates to Azure using DefaultAzureCredential (works with CLI/login).
Connects to a specific Azure Log Analytics workspace using its ID.
Queries the AppRequests table to fetch all failed HTTP requests from the past 24 hours.
Filters for failed requests using Success == false.

Extracts relevant fields like:
TimeGenerated (timestamp)
Name (request name)
Url (endpoint)
ResultCode (HTTP status code)
DurationMs (duration in milliseconds)

Exports the data into a CSV report: failed_requests_report.csv.
